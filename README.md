README for  SWEN20003 Project 2B

This project involves using object orientated principles to design a basic video game in Java. To get the game to run, clone the repository and open it up in your IDE. 
Open the ShadowTreasure class an run the main method. If you get an error, you need to rename the folder and run it again, then it should work.
